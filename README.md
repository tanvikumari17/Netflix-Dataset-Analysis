# Netflix-Dataset-Analysis
In this project, we analyze the Netflix dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. We focus on the distribution of movies and TV shows, their genres, countries of origin, and release dates. Using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover insights into the types and quantity of content available on Netflix.
