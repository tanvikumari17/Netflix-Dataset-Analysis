# Netflix Dataset Analysis
In this project, we analyze the Netflix dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Our primary focus is on understanding the distribution of movies and TV shows, their genres, countries of origin, and release dates. By leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover detailed insights into the types and quantity of content available on Netflix.

## Objectives
- Distribution Analysis: Examine the distribution of movies and TV shows on Netflix to understand the platform's content balance.
- Genre Analysis: Identify the most common genres and observe trends over time to see how viewer preferences and content offerings have evolved.
- Country of Origin: Explore the diversity of content by analyzing the countries of origin, highlighting the global nature of Netflix's library.
- Release Dates: Investigate the release patterns and frequency to see how Netflix's content strategy has changed over the years.

## Tools and Libraries
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
- Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Key Findings
